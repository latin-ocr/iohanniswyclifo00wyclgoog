INTRODUCTION.

When the ‘Magister' John Huss started on his jouruey to Con·
stance‚ in the autumn of 1414, his intention was not so much to
justify himself and answer for his doctrines before the assembled
Fathers, as to gain over the Oecumenical Council and the whole of

velit addiscere. P. 147: llla lex fuit nobis data ad regulandum nos in via. ² Lex
Christi foret per se sufficiens ad totam militantem ecclesiam regulandum melius quam
regitur per tradiciones hominum introductas . . . dictum est sepius quod iste leges
sunt acceptande a fidelibus7 de quanto consonant legi Dei. ³ P. 200: Bonum
